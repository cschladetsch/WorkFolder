# WorkFolder Documentation
If you have this file locally, you probably have your work-station folder setup installed. If not, see [WorkFolder](https://github.com/cschladetsch/WorkFolder).

The general idea of `WorkFolder` is that we can all share the same development environment across multiple machines.

When an update is made, the user updates their work folder with:

```bash
$ cd $WORK_DRIVE && git pull
```

## Installers

Installing `git-tip`.

First, install [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then install `git-tip` via:

```bash
$ npm install --global git-tip
```
