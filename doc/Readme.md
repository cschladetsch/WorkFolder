# Work-Folder Documentation
If you have this file locally, you probably have the _Liminal_ work-station folder setup installed. If not, see [WorkFolder](https://github.com/LiminalVR/WorkFolder).

The general idea of `WorkFolder` is that we can all share the same development environment across multiple machines.

When an update is made, the user updates their work folder with:

```bash
$ cd $WORK_DIR
$ git checkout develop && git pull
```

If this doesn't work, see *Contacts* below.

## Contents
* **Git-Commands.md**. A useful resource for common `git` commands used at Liminal.

### doc/defaults
There are a number of default files that are used to populate a new project:

* **Readme-default.md**. Default Readme.md file for a sub-system.
* **Readme-Project-default.md**. Default Readme.md file for either a project.

## Todo
Nothing at the moment.
