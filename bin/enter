# TODO: enter current project if it is a Liminal project. This is determined by it having a .proj folder in root

# Note that $WORK_ROOT/.proj (will) exist, as well as $WORK_ROOT/SomeProject/.enter. This script will determine what is going on and bootstrap/enter correctly in either case.

# Yes, this is necessarily complicated. There will be `global` changes in $WORK_ROOT/.proj as well as per-project specific customisations in $WORK_ROOT/SomeProject/.proj

# .proj/bin should be added to PATH whenever you enter, as well as adding aliases and other helpful things
